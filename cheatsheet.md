# Rozettas' Cheatsheet for weirdo talks

### In a vertical model we are referring to different layers:

* **Frontend**:

  Frontend is practically the skin of the product. Also, you can imagine this part of the application as a physical manifestation.


* **Backend**:

  On the other hand, backend is the mind that controls the behaviour of the application.


* **Storage**:

  Physical computers utilized to store your data (mostly in some secure virtual environment) just like your HDD/SDD/Memory card/etc.


* **Database**:

  Database is a logical version of storage. It is a program, allowing you to store the data based on a predefined structure.


* **A**plication **P**rogramming **I**nterface (API):

  Part of a program, or a door, allowing the program to interact with the outside world, e.g. sending and receiving information from and to another program.</br></br>

### Type of applications

* **Monolith**:

  Thinking about method of creation, monolith application is build as a single unit, and the whole code base is treated as a single application. We are developing every feature to that single application.


* **Service mesh(*Microservices*)**:

  Features are developed in groups, where every single group is a separate application, connected with each other through APIs.

### Others

* **Feature**:

  Feature is a function of the application. It has its own vertical model and dependencies.


* **Cloud**:

  Fancy version of referring to the whole bunch of bare metal.


* **V**irtual **P**rivate **S**erver (VPS):

  Virtual machine that splitting up and using bare metal's resource to have more independent virtual machines.


* **Container**:

  Container is practically a VPS, but in this case the virtualization happens using another method. Such containers have less lifecycle compared to the classical virtualization.


* **Cluster**:

  Cluster is a virtual environment that is able to host and connect the arbitrary number of containers in a private network.


* **Container Orchestration**:

  Is the automatic process  that controlling the container lifecycle and health in a Cluster environment.
  

* **DevOps lifecycle** (Software development (Dev) and IT operations (Ops)):

  The developer's path, consisting of operations and development practices, or a journey of product development from the start till the release.
